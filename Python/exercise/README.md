# Iron Forge Gym - Optimized Training Tracker

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- Split monolithic `app.py` into separate modules:
  - `models.py` - Database models and helper functions
  - `routes.py` - Route handlers with proper organization
  - `auth.py` - Authentication decorators
  - `app_optimized.py` - Main application factory

### 2. **Database Query Optimization**
- Added eager loading with `joinedload()` to prevent N+1 queries
- Changed relationships to `lazy='dynamic'` for better performance
- Optimized queries in dashboard and client views

### 3. **Template Organization**
- Moved inline HTML to separate template files
- Created base template for better caching and maintainability
- Reduced memory overhead from string templates

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Added try-catch blocks around all database operations
- Proper rollback on database errors
- User-friendly error messages

### 5. **Authentication**
- Created reusable decorators (`@login_required`, `@admin_required`, `@client_only`)
- Eliminated repetitive session checks
- Cleaner route definitions

### 6. **Security Improvements**
- Environment variable support for sensitive config
- Disabled debug mode in production
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
