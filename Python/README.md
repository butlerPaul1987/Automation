# Python automation

## tasks I've written to automate life 

### Automation for me
This is a small script I'd written to automate my morning routine and make myself more productive.

### Load VMs
This is a small script I'd written to load our test VM's as again this saved me time and energy.

### Projects
- Number guessing game:		I used this to get used to how Python works and create something small, but fun
- Rock, Paper, Scissors game:	I used this to get used to how Python works and create something small, but fun

### Rewards for two
This was something I did to explore Selenuium and fully automate tasks, it is something I'm still very proud of
